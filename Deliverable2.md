> formatted and the links are links in here.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Class (scheduling system)

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Geena Rustia

**Git Master**: Brinson Doederlin

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)

Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is
just the documentation.

**Sprint Goal:** The team goal for Sprint 2 is to implement major features of Gym Class Scheduling software such as
refactoring relevant data to the classes, storing relevant information the most efficient way so the client receives the
perfectly working software.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** : 3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**  5 total
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We decided to add these US because they all meet the requirements for Sprint 2 the best. We tried to keep the tasks
> for our US short and relatively simple so they can be completed the most efficient way to deliver the working
> software.
**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These user stories fit well with our Sprint goal since we are trying to focus on the back-end developing of our
> software to make sure the program performs the correct way. The team decided to keep UI implementation simple during
> this Sprint.
**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we do.

## 2: During the Sprint

> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as
> explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
> I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work
> at
> the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):

> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3,
> not needed before that).

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/sp20kHkPm-o

> Answer the following questions as a team.

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> I believe that the team created a lot of value during this sprint. We were able to create new code while also
> repurposing the original code, which allowed us to work efficiently and effectively. In terms of the specific value
> that
> we added, I think we made significant improvements in the adapting existing functionality, fixed some critical bugs
> and
> issues, and added new features to represent a gym class scheduling software.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> I think our team worked hard and put a lot of effort into figuring out how to get things done, but at times we may
> have gotten caught up in the process and lost sight of the end goal. While we made progress on certain tasks, I think
> there were opportunities to be more productive and efficient. Overall, I believe I worked hard and did our best to
> contribute to this sprint's goals.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> I think there may have been room for improvement in terms of the user interface. While we were able to reuse a lot of
> original code, we may not have put as much emphasis on creating a more visually appealing or user-friendly interface.
> Overall, I think we did a good job of meeting the main requirements of the project and delivering what the customer
> was
> looking for. We plan to advanced and refine the user interface in sprint 3.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do
> not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a
> Yes
> or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did
> work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following
> tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> The team meet almost all goals expect for this sprint. We created all the backend functional in order to display
> relevant information.
**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Yes

**If not, what went wrong?**

> N/A

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you
start working when the deadline approached.)**

> While we did work consistently as a team throughout the sprint, I think we could have improved our approach by
> including tasks for outlining our design. This may have helped us work at an even more consistent rate of speed and
> ensure that we were on track to meet our goals. Also while the team was meeting regularly, the scrum master should
> have
> given more guidance.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, our team delivered business value through our work on the backend.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Yes, there are a few areas where we think we can improve in the next Sprint. First, we need to create more preparation
> tasks to ensure that we have a clear understanding of what needs to be done before we start working on larger tasks.
> Additionally, we need to make sure that we break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones to help us stay
> on
> track and ensure that we are making progress.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> The team feels relieved that sprint 2 is done and a lot of backend work has been done. We feel as if we all have a
> better understanding of the scrum process, memoranda, and how we are going to move forward. We are going to learn from
> the mistakes made in sprint 2, to ensure that sprint 3 is more on track. We feel confident we will improve based off
> this reflection.

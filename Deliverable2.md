# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** NO.2

**Scrum Master**: Will Jedynak 

**Git Master**: Joshua Benn

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Our Sprint goal is to create features which allow the addition and creation of various objects for the program

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  2

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 6

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These user stores are adding more basic functions to thoroughly provide the necessary capabilities to the rest of the program

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> The user stories chosen are all in line with adding/creating various objects for the program and enabling underlying capabilities to read and write these objects to the json file.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|-------|---|---|---|--|--|
|23-06-11 |   | Sprint 2 Planning  |   |  |  |
|23-06-24 | Frankie, Andres | Sprint2 debrief |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Eli : 5

   Josh : 5
   
   Will : 3

   Andres : 2

   Frankie : 1
   
## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> JSON handler works and saves and loads data lots of UI elements created.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> As a whole, we accomplished most tasks for this sprint, so yes.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, functionality that we wanted created is clear, and concise. This would make the customer satisfied.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Very close, we are missing functionality to add buses to routes, and routes to tours.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Backend functionality longer to implement for the first couple of steps, but now development speed should now increase.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> No, the beginning of the Sprint was the most active.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Need more commits and one more group meeting in the middle of the sprint

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We're doing very well.

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually). Some of the topcs are not needed for the first deliverables (you should know which things you should have done in this Sprint, if you don't then you have probably missed something):

### Quality Policy
> Describe your Quality Policy in detail for this Sprint (remember what I ask you to do when I talk about the "In your Project" part in the lectures and what is mentioned after each assignment (in due course you will need to fill out all of them, check which ones are needed for each Deliverable). You should keep adding things to this file and adjusting your policy as you go.
> Check in Project: Module Concepts document on Canvas in the Project module for more details 

**GitHub Workflow** (start Sprint 1)
  > We have a main development branch, called "development", which is a sub-branch of master. For each User-story on our Taiga board, a branch will be created off of the development branch. When an individual assigns themselves a task from the Taiga board, they should create a branch for that specific task off of its corresponding User story. When a task is complete the Git master can be notified to merge the task into the User story branch. When all tasks of a User story are completed and merged, the User story branch can be merged into development by the Git master. At the end of sprint, development will be merged into master.

### Quality Policy
>Our quality policy aims to ensure the overall quality of the project throughout its development cycle. It encompasses the following key aspects:
1.	Functionality: The program should deliver the intended functionality as specified in the user stories and requirements. Thorough testing will be conducted to ensure that all features work correctly and meet user expectations.
2.	Usability: The user interface should be intuitive, user-friendly, and consistent. Usability studies and user feedback will guide the improvement of the interface, ensuring that users can easily navigate and interact with the program.
3.	Localization: The program should support multiple languages and display symbols and text accurately. Localization issues will be addressed to provide a seamless experience for users in different regions and languages.
4.	Visual Consistency: The program's visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and layout, should be consistent throughout the interface. Design standards and guidelines will be followed to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing user experience.
5.	Branding: The program's branding, including the logo, splash screen, and program name, will be designed to reflect the desired image and create a memorable identity for the application.
6.	Performance: The program should perform efficiently and respond promptly to user actions. Performance testing and optimization will be conducted to enhance the program's responsiveness and minimize any delays or bottlenecks.
7.	Code Quality: The codebase should adhere to best practices and coding standards. Attention will be given to readability, maintainability, and scalability. Warnings and errors will be addressed promptly to maintain a clean and robust codebase.
8.	Continuous Testing: Unit tests, both blackbox and whitebox, will be developed to verify the functionality and integrity of the code. Automated testing will be integrated into the development process to ensure continuous quality assurance.
9.	Collaboration: Developers will actively engage in code reviews to promote knowledge sharing, identify potential issues, and improve code quality. A checklist will be followed during code reviews to ensure thorough examination and feedback.
10.	Documentation: Clear and comprehensive documentation will be provided to aid developers, users, and maintainers. This includes user manuals, API documentation, and inline code comments.
11.	Continuous Improvement: Feedback from users, stakeholders, and team members will be actively sought and used to continuously improve the quality of the program. Lessons learned from previous sprints will be applied to refine development processes and practices.

**GitHub Workflow** (start Sprint 1)
1. Create a new branch for each user story or task based on the main branch.
2. Develop and implement the changes for each user story or task in their respective branches.
3. Regularly commit changes and push them to the remote repository.
4. Once the development is complete, create a Pull Request to merge the branch into the main branch.
5. Assign a team member for code review.
6. Upon successful code review, merge the branch into the main branch.
7. Monitor and resolve any merge conflicts, if they occur.
8. Repeat the process for each user story or task in the Sprint backlog.

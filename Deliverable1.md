## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Joseph Okonoboh

**Git Master**: Aman Sharma

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** For this Sprint we are focusing on fixing small bugs and errors so that memoranda run according to our selected topic. We are also working over designing memoranda so that it looks like Gym scheduling.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  12

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> We have added total 9 user stories to sprint 1.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> The user stories we decided to add focus on structural and design enhancements to the program, they are weighted 28 points in total. Each person will work on approximately 5 to 6 points worth of work to complete for this sprint.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These user stories will lay the foundation to transition to our topic of choice as well as fix many known issues within the program structure and execution.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, this sprint we are planning to focus on the design and structural side of software.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|05/29/2023   | Everyone attended  | Team member selected their task to work on  |  on track |  |  |

   Name1 : Num Meetings

   Name2 : Num Meetings


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [Your link](https://youtu.be/hFjTmFZCYAQ)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> For this sprint our goal was to fix any existing errors to the program, identify mistakes/errors in the legacy code, and prepare the software to be transformed in the next sprint.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We all tried our best to complete the user stories. The number of user stories that we created for this sprint was not enough, and we overestimated/underestimated some of the tasks and their points. However, each of us who worked on the project, contributed as much as possible.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

>  We believe that the customer's expectations were somewhat met during this sprint. As mentioned above, our goal for this sprint was to identify and fix any existing errors.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we have met our sprint goal of understanding the inner-workings of memoranda and fixing any existing errors. For example, many of the tasks in our user stories required a deep dive into the source code to identify bugs and fix them. We  also worked over designing memoranda so that it looks like Gym scheduling.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No, we have not completed all stories in our backlog. In this sprint we overed 75% of our expected task. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We overestimated/underestimated some of the tasks and their points. However, each of us who worked on the project, contributed as much as possible.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Our Taiga chart does show consistent rate of work; however, the first week of the sprint was focused on getting familiar with the project, github, and the team. The main work started in week 2 in which we made many changes so that memoranda looks like Gym Scheduling.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, we fixed existing errors in the software, came up with a new logo for the software and made it display when running.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> The only thing I believe we can do is getting better on communication but rest team is really productive and do thingd beyond expected.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Team is really productive and I think in future we don't get into any problem.

# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** NO.1

**Scrum Master**: Josh Benn 

**Git Master**: Elias Garcia

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Our current sprint goal is to set up the fundamental classes and begin work on the algorithm for the routes and further visualization windows for route assignment

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  8

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 4

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These user stores are required for the basic structure and objects for the entire project.  Most of the user stories are relatively simple tasks to accomplish

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> As stated above, they are required for the basic structure of the project

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
| 5/27/2023 | Andres  | initial Sprint 1 meeting  | on track  | n/a | |
| 5/28/2023 | Andres  | Adding user stories  | on track  | n/a | |
| 5/31/2023 |   | Checkin meeting, inform team on new new objects | on track  | n/a | |
| 6/4/2023  |   | General progress discussion/algorithm design for Nodes | behind  | n/a | | 
| 6/8/2023  | Andres, Josh  | Wrapup meeting with most of group | behind | n/a | | 
| 6/9/2023  | Frankie  | Sprint 1 finalization meeting | n/a | |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Will : 6

   Eli : 6
   
   Andres : 3
   
   Josh : 5
   
   Frankie : 5

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Established foundation and garnered how we will proceed with the project.


**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> As a whole, more could have gotten done, but individually some went above and beyond (Eli)

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes, the team is well on the way to delivering the product.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, everyone on the team has a working knowledge of the Memoranda Framework

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No, planned to complete too many User Stories

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Planned to complete too many User Stories, needed more team communication.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> No, time allocation and team communication could have improved.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> No, we do not have a finished product.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Coordination, communication and awareness as a team.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Collectively, we feel optimistic, but we all recognize that our collective collaboration must improve.

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually). Some of the topcs are not needed for the first deliverables (you should know which things you should have done in this Sprint, if you don't then you have probably missed something):

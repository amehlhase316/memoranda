# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Class (scheduling system)

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Gustavo Lezama

**Git Master**: Ben Meddeb

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Our goal for Sprint 1 is to familiarize ourselves with the system/program itself. Another goal is to fix bugs in the user interface. The team will mostly work on front-end stuff and hope to get a deep understanding about how the program works.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** : 3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**  10 total
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added the the necessary tasks to our Sprint 1 so the team could easily navigate into the code. We are planning to fix some issue with warnings and front-end errors/bugs. 

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

These fit well with our Sprint 1 goal because the team needs to get a good understanding and knowledge of the software without being overwhelmed. The program also needs to be cleaned up before making any major changes and moving deeper into the project.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we need to implement and create a gym class scheduling software from the memoranda software.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

### Sprint Retrospective

By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

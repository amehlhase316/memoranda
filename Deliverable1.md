**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> Your Answer
=======
> We chose to add these US because the team deemed them to be an important focus of improvement. When discussing the future functionality and look of the software, we decided these user stories would become blocks if we did not make them a higher priority. We have chunked the US into manageable tasks with practical scopes for our first Sprint.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These fit well with our Sprint goal because we want to start building out the software for our project topic. These US allow us to explore the software in the state we have received it
 while also improving the user's experience.

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|  5/29 |  n/a |  Sprint 1 planning, created user stories and ensured each team member had a clear understanding of their tasks | beginning of sprint, but on track | x | x |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Robert Bruice : 1/1

   Chase Whitehouse : 1/1

   Andrea Schoonover : 1/1

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Henry Buck

**Git Master**: Sam Garcia

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Sprint goal

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  Number

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 

> Eight user stories were added.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> The user stories that were added were the ones from the example Taiga board.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> The first sprint was an intro to the software and utilizing git/github so a lot of the base user stories reflect that.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> We do, and we also will ask in slack for any clarification we require as it arises.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|5/29|David B.|Got Memoranda working|N/A|N/A|Attendence not strictly necessary, helping each other get set up|
|5/31|Everyone Here|Taiga setup, User Stories set|N/A|N/A|  |
|6/9|Everyone Here|Final Meeting for sprint|N/A|N/A| |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

    -David Berry:         II
    -Jonathan Blicharz:   III
    -Henry Buck:          III
    -Sam Garcia:          III
    -Abdullah Younes:     III

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: Your link``

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We all got a good handle on how memoranda works as well as an idea of how to continue next sprint. In addition to this we worked together to make sure we understood how Git and GitHub work.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We believe that we did, yes.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> For this sprint since it was more of an intro to sprints for the class it is unlikely that we would have met customer expectations. However we did meet the class expectations.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we met the sprint goal.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Not quite, but we did take a look at and complete most of the user stories sub tasks.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We discovered that one of the subtasks for a user story, resizing the calendar, was more time intensive than we originally had planned and decided to add that to a later user story.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> We mostly did a consistent speed, we didn't leave it all for the end. However towards the second half we definitely realized we had more left than we originally planned.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We got a good handle of how the software works which is a good first step towards delivering business value.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Communicate more frequently

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We all feel good about where we're at and how the team is progressing

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually). Some of the topcs are not needed for the first deliverables (you should know which things you should have done in this Sprint, if you don't then you have probably missed something):

 **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:

    - We generated the Quality Policy together, however as the scrum master for this round I was the one typing everything and getting the phrasing down. Honestly because we all were just talking together while I was typing it, it's hard to remember who came up with what. I do believe I was at least part of the group who said that one person reviewing any pull requests should be sufficient (so as to not make us locked up in waiting for multiple pull request approvals)

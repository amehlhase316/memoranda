## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Class Scheduling 

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Brinson Doederlin

**Git Master**: Ben Meddeb

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)

SPRINT 1:

**Sprint Goal:** Our goal for Sprint 1 is to familiarize ourselves with the system/program itself. Another goal is to fix bugs in the user interface. The team will mostly work on front-end stuff and hope to get a deep understanding about how the program works.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** : 3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**  10 total
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added the the necessary tasks to our Sprint 1 so the team could easily navigate into the code. We are planning to fix some issue with warnings and front-end errors/bugs. 

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

These fit well with our Sprint 1 goal because the team needs to get a good understanding and knowledge of the software without being overwhelmed. The program also needs to be cleaned up before making any major changes and moving deeper into the project.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we need to implement and create a gym class scheduling software from the memoranda software.

SPRINT 2:

**Sprint Goal:** The team goal for Sprint 2 is to implement major features of Gym Class Scheduling software such as
refactoring relevant data to the classes, storing relevant information the most efficient way so the client receives the
perfectly working software.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** : 3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:**  5 total
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We decided to add these US because they all meet the requirements for Sprint 2 the best. We tried to keep the tasks
> for our US short and relatively simple so they can be completed the most efficient way to deliver the working
> software.
**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These user stories fit well with our Sprint goal since we are trying to focus on the back-end developing of our
> software to make sure the program performs the correct way. The team decided to keep UI implementation simple during
> this Sprint.
**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we do.

SPRINT 3:

Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:**  Our goal is going to be to display a Gym schedule as well as finish adapting the UI to represent the needs of the client. Lastly, we plan to clean up any remaining bugs we find. 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 4
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These user stories are mostly to polish the UI. Also we plan on removing excess features and fixing any bugs found. These tasks are reasonable for the Sprint 3 because most of the back end implementation has been completed in sprint 2. 

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These user stories are consistent with our sprint goal because this sprint is about pulling the whole program together and testing to fix an bugs found.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we plan on meeting to discuss UI design decisions. After the team has a mutual understanding we plan to get right into the user stories. 



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas.
> I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**:
[Screencast](https://youtu.be/B7KI1Sw-LYE)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

>Based on the requested features described, it appears that the team has successfully implemented all of the required functionalities and even improved the user interface of the software. Therefore, the value created this Sprint is a fully functional and user-friendly gym class scheduling software.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

>In terms of working enough and meeting expectations, it seems that the team has successfully completed all of the required functionalities while also trying to add other features. Therefore, the team can confidently say they have worked enough and met expectations.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

>As for meeting customer expectations, the team has successfully met all the requested features and also improved the user interface, which provides a clean and simple experience for the customer. Therefore, it is safe to say that the team has met customer expectations.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

>As a team, we can confidently say that we met our sprint goal. Our team had consistent meetings, discussions, and semi-consistent commits throughout the sprint, which allowed us to stay on track and complete all the required functionalities within the given time frame.

>Additionally, we can provide evidence of our progress and completion of tasks by referring to the rate of commits in our Git logs, which demonstrate consistent and steady progress throughout the sprint. Moreover, each team member was able to complete their assigned tasks within the given time frame, which further indicates that we met our sprint goal.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Yes and furthermore, we can provide evidence of our completion of all stories on the Spring Backlog by referring to our progress and completion of tasks in the Git logs, which demonstrate that we completed all of the stories and functionalities that were outlined in the backlog. Additionally, each team member was able to complete their assigned tasks within the given time frame, which further indicates that we completed all the stories on the Spring Backlog.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Only things that went wrong is that we could not handle all tasks, with 2 of our group mates dropping the class, and that leaves only 3 of us to work on the group project.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> As a team, we worked as hard as we could during the Sprint, despite facing significant challenges that impacted our ability to work at a consistent rate. We had a huge homework assignment to manage alongside the project and the tasks were interdependent, which meant that many of them relied on each other to be completed before they could be tested. Additionally, the significant UI implementation requirements made the tasks more time-consuming and challenging.Despite these challenges, we were still able to complete all the tasks on time.

> Regarding our commit history, it may create a misconception that we allocated most of our efforts towards the beginning of the project, rather than the end.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, as a team, we delivered business value by completing all of the requested functionalities within the given time frame. Despite facing challenges, such as interdependent tasks and significant UI implementation requirements. 

> As a team, we followed the Scrum process, held regular meetings, tested and reviewed code, and updated the Taiga board. We faced challenges that impacted our workflow, but were able to complete tasks early enough for full system tests. Due to the project's scale, we couldn't complete tasks in a timely manner, but we accurately moved them on the Taiga board. This was an improvement from last sprint.

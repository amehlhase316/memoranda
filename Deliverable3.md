# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 3
**Scrum Master**: Sam Garcia
**Git Master**: Abdullah Younes

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** For this sprint we focused on implementing the functionality of a few remaining panels, including, including the Sign Up page, the Trainer tab, and the Admin Page. Additionally, the team implemented the notes feature from the home panel, and a few other features to help tie together the app.


**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 0

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> We added a total of 18 user stories to this sprint.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> While there were a substantial amount of features to implement before our product could be considered finished, we planned to work on all remaining necessary features throughout this last spring.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> All of the features the team worked on were directly related to the sprint goals, besides a few minor quality of life changes, such as updating the version number.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> The team understands what we need to work on and is planning to implement the functionality of our last few panels, as well as adding additional features to the home tab once the user has signed in.
## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
| 7/5  |   | Caught up on what we need to work on | Slightly behind |  |  |
| 7/8  |   | Got login feature working and approved pull | On Track  |  |  |
| 7/9  |   | Finished assembling project, created Screencast | On track  |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

    -David Berry:         3
    -Jonathan Blicharz:   3
    -Henry Buck:          3
    -Sam Garcia:          3
    -Abdullah Younes:     3

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/_JsyHvf8ZbE

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We were able to finish implementing most of the base functionality of the application. This included logging in, signing up for classes, creating classes, adding times available for trainers, and other things. This final version of the application could serve as a minimum viable product for a company.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> While the UI could use some minor improvement, the functionality expected from the team is working. Trainers can create classes, and users can login and sign up, and times can be set and recorded in the repository.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> There are some additional features we could implement if we were attempting a public launch, but the functionality of the program is complete. 

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Our team met the sprint goal and was able to complete all required user stories for the project. Any issue that would be placed on the backlog was minor enough not to include for the product we were required to complete.

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> A handful of user stories were placed on in sprint 3 from the backlog, but all were completed. Additionally, no more user stories or tasks are being placed on the backlog, so it is clear.


**If not, what went wrong?**

> All user stories on the backlog were completed, and none were added, so nothing went wrong.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> The velocity of our team’s progress started off a bit slow as multiple members were coming off of finals and other project, but everyone put in much more effort as the deadline approached to make sure goals were getting met.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Our team produced a working product, which I would say is good value considering how dilapidated the codebase we started on was.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

>  If we could work on the project longer we would implement smaller features that we weren't able to get to in this sprint, such as editing classes, changing the privacy of the classes, and other quality of life changes.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> The team is confident with our work.

# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Paul Carmichael

**Git Master**: Ryan Dinaro

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Transform memoranda's UI to better suit a gym scheduling software, and add functionality/features for gym scheduling. We added unit test in this sprint also.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  12

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> We have added a total of 9 user stories to sprint 3.

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These user stories transform memoranda to look more like gym scheduling software. Each user story has the better assignment of points.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> The user stories add functionality to the gym scheduling software.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we have a general idea of what needs to be done. Everyone will do their best to contribute to the success of the sprint.

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that).

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [Your link](https://youtu.be/AymBJxaGlXQ)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We transformed memoranda to better suit a gym scheduling system and added specific functionality for it.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Even though we are behind on our tasks and user stories, people worked hard to commit as many changes as possible in the given timeline.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

>  We did our best to meet the customer's expectations fully, but some expectations were not fulfilled.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence-based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we have met our sprint goal. We transformed memoranda to better suit a gym scheduling system and added specific functionality for it.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No, we have not completed all stories in our backlog. In this sprint we overed 80% of our expected task. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We overestimated/underestimated some of the tasks and their points. However, each of us who worked on the project, contributed as much as possible.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Our Taiga chart does show consistent rate of work; however, the first week of the sprint was focused on getting familiar with the project, github, and the team. The main work started in week 2 in which we made many changes so that memoranda looks like Gym Scheduling.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes. We believe that we transformed memoranda to better suit a gym scheduling system; hence, delivering business value.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Each team member tries their best in completing the US. We will try to come up with more productive US.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Each team member tries their best in completing the US. But we believe we can do better next time.
